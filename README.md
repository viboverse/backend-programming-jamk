# Exercise diary (template)

This file is used to track the total completion of the exercises. The file should be updated after working on each exercise set. You can use the markdown checklist feature to represent your progress: x in brackets for completed (either fully or partially), squiggly line in brackets or empty brackets for not implemented/started.

NOTICE: There are separate return boxes in Moodle for all the individual exercise sets. Make the Moodle submission, when you want feedback and the exercise set to be graded.
