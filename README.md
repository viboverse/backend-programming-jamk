# Exercise diary / Firstname Lastname (template)

This file is used to track the total completion of the exercises and for self-assessment/comments. Replace `Firstname` and `Lastname` with your actual name. The file should be updated after working on each exercise set. You can use the GitLab markdown checklist feature to represent your progress: x in brackets for completed (either fully or partially), squiggly line in brackets or empty brackets for not implemented/started.

```markdown
- [x] Task 1: 2/2 points - All done
- [~] Task 2: 0/3 points - Not implemented
- [ ] Task 3: 0/3 points - Not started 
```

Renders as:
- [x] Task 1: 2/2 points - All done
- [~] Task 2: 0/3 points - Not implemented
- [ ] Task 3: 0/3 points - Not started 


> NOTICE: There are separate return boxes in Moodle for all the individual exercise sets. Complete the Moodle submission, when you want feedback and the exercise set to be graded.
